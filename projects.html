          <h3>TASAdot "The Anti Spiking App"</h3>
          <p>TASA is a community-oriented organisation that seeks to combat the issue of drink spiking within nightlife community. In the UK and globally, the statistics on drink spiking are grossly inaccurate and the scale of the problem is misrepresented. We will aim to bring to light the gravity of this problem, starting with altering the lexicon surrounding it. Drink spiking is poisoning with the attempt to incapacitate and should be understood as such. We will encourage members to get involved through our app and website, which will feature a self-report system, literature on how to cope when spiked as well as several other facets to inform and protect. TASA is committed to addressing the problem with the data as well as promoting a culture of social accountability that the current nightlife community lacks. We believe in breaking down the culture of shame that many victims face, and we will do this by looking to the community as a whole to action collective change and have one another’s backs.</p>
